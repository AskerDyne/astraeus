With pre-built cogs for soft moderation too, ease-of-control measures, and a multitude of features. Astraeus is the perfect addition to your Discord server if you want passive support.

**Neural Network Assistance**:

Astraeus harnesses the power of its neural network to intelligently respond to general prompts, making interactions with your community more engaging and dynamic. With over 30 pre-programmed responses too for the times the neural network just doesn't quite hit the mark.
The open-source nature of the neural training data also means you can contribute your own data to aid in Astras' growth! 

**Soft Moderation Cogs**:

It's pre-trained on over 1,700 words and 3,500 phrases, Astra passively scans messages (*without logging them*) and simply deletes any messages that aren't flavourful, if you have a logging bot enabled, only then may the deleted messages get logged.
